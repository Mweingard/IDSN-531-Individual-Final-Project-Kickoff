# IDSN-531-Individual-Final-Project-Kickoff

USC Schedule Builder is a website designed to help USC students plan their semester schedules quickly and efficiently. Users can paste a USC class schedule link, select departments of interest (CSCI, ACAD, BUAD, IDSN, etc.), and indicate their preferred times on a grid similar to When2Meet. The app will filter courses based on user constraints, highlight schedule conflicts, and display viable schedules. The main goal is to build a functional, interactive website that demonstrates understanding of frontend development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally React and Node.js. This project also explores dynamic UI creation, user experience design, and, if a backend is used, API development and data persistence. The primary audience are USC undergraduate and graduate students who want a faster, more intuitive way to plan their course schedules, avoiding the time-consuming process of manually checking courses and conflicts on WebReg.
